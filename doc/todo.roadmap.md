## Roadmap
### Stage 1: "Minimalism" (Core Turing Completeness)
- Variables and assignment
- Basic arithmetic (+, -)
- Conditionals (if)
- Loops (while)
- Arrays for memory





### Stage ?: "Basic Expressiveness"
- Complete arithmetic operators (*, /, %, etc.)
- Logical operators (and, or, not)
- Comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=)
- More control structures (for loops, case/switch statements)
- Basic data types (integers, floats, booleans, chars)

### Stage ?: "Procedural Abstraction"
- Function definitions and calls
- Parameter passing
- Return values
- Scope rules

### Stage ?: "Data Organization"
- Composite types (tuples, records/objects)
- String handling
- Enumerations
- Type aliases
- Collections (sets, sequences)

### Stage ?: "Type System"
- Static type checking
- Type inference
- Generic types
- User-defined types
- Type conversion rules

### Stage ?: "Object-Oriented Features"
- Object types with methods
- Inheritance
- Method dispatch
- Interfaces/concepts
- Operator overloading

### Stage ?: "Advanced Abstraction"
- Modules and imports
- Iterators
- Closures
- Higher-order functions
- Templates and macros

### Stage ?: "Memory Management"
- Manual memory allocation/deallocation
- Garbage collection
- Reference counting
- Move semantics
- Resource management patterns

### Stage ?: "Concurrency & Systems"
- Threading primitives
- Async/await
- Exception handling
- FFI (Foreign Function Interface)
- System-level operations

### Stage ?: "Optimization & Pragmatics"
- Compiler hints and pragmas
- Inline assembly
- Advanced optimizations
- Conditional compilation
- Build system integration
